	abstract = {Severe malaria is primarily caused by Plasmodium falciparum parasites during their asexual reproduction cycle within red blood cells. One of the least understood stages in this cycle is the brief preinvasion period during which merozoite-red cell contacts lead to apical alignment of the merozoite in readiness for penetration, a stage of major relevance in the control of invasion efficiency. Red blood cell deformations associated with this process were suggested to be active plasma membrane responses mediated by transients of elevated intracellular calcium. Few studies have addressed this hypothesis because of technical challenges, and the results remained inconclusive. Here, Fluo-4 was used as a fluorescent calcium indicator with optimized protocols to investigate the distribution of the dye in red blood cell populations used as P. falciparum invasion targets in egress-invasion assays. Preinvasion dynamics was observed simultaneously under bright-field and fluorescence microscopy by recording egress-invasion events. All the egress-invasion sequences showed red blood cell deformations of varied intensities during the preinvasion period and the echinocytic changes that follow during invasion. Intraerythrocytic calcium signals were absent throughout this interval in over half the records and totally absent during the preinvasion period, regardless of deformation strength. When present, calcium signals were of a punctate modality, initiated within merozoites already poised for invasion. These results argue against a role of elevated intracellular calcium during the preinvasion stage. We suggest an alternative mechanism of merozoite-induced preinvasion deformations based on passive red cell responses to transient agonist-receptor interactions associated with the formation of adhesive coat filaments.},

	abstract = {Malarial fever arises from the synchronous bursting of human red blood cells by the Plasmodium parasite. The released parasites re-infect neighboring red blood cells and undergo another asexual cycle of differentiation and proliferation for 48 hours, before again bursting synchronously. The synchrony of bursting is lost during in vitro culturing of the parasite outside the human body, presumably because the asexual cycle is no longer entrained by host-specific circadian cues. Therefore, most in vitro malaria studies have relied on the artificial synchronization of the parasite population. However, much remains unknown about the degree of timing heterogeneity of asexual cycles and how artificial synchronization may affect this timing. Here, we combined time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, long-term culturing and follow single cells to directly observe and measure the heterogeneous timing of in vitro asexual cycles. We first demonstrate that unsynchronized laboratory cultures are not fully asynchronous and the parasites exhibit a bimodal distribution in their first burst times. We then show that synchronized and unsynchronized cultures had similar asexual cycle periods, which indicates that artificial synchronization does not fundamentally perturb asexual cycle dynamics. Last, we demonstrate that sibling parasites descended from the same schizont exhibited significant variation in asexual cycle period, although smaller than the variation between non-siblings. The additional variance between non-siblings likely arises from the variable environments and/or developmental programs experienced in different host cells.},

No such vaccine currently exists, and only a handful of the hundreds of potential candidates in the parasite genome have been evaluated. In this study, we systematically evaluated 29 antigens likely to be involved in erythrocyte invasion, an essential developmental stage during which the malaria parasite is vulnerable to antibody-mediated inhibition. Testing antigens alone and in combination identified several strain-transcending targets that had synergistic combinatorial effects in vitro, while studies in an endemic population revealed that combinations of the same antigens were associated with protection from febrile malaria. Video microscopy established that the most effective combinations targeted multiple discrete stages of invasion, suggesting a mechanistic explanation for synergy. Overall, this study both identifies specific antigen combinations for high-priority clinical testing and establishes a generalizable approach that is more likely to produce effective vaccines.},

@article{Kennard2016,
	abstract = {The mean size of exponentially dividing E. coli cells cultured in different nutrient conditions is known to depend on the mean growth rate only. However, the joint fluctuations relating cell size, doubling time and individual growth rate are only starting to be characterized. Recent studies in bacteria (i) revealed the near constancy of the size extension in a single cell cycle (adder mechanism), and (ii) reported a universal trend where the spread in both size and doubling times is a linear function of the population means of these variables. Here, we combine experiments and theory and use scaling concepts to elucidate the constraints posed by the second observation on the division control mechanism and on the joint fluctuations of sizes and doubling times. We found that scaling relations based on the means both collapse size and doubling-time distributions across different conditions, and explain how the shape of their joint fluctuations deviates from the means. Our data on these joint fluctuations highlight the importance of cell individuality: single cells do not follow the dependence observed for the means between size and either growth rate or inverse doubling time. Our calculations show that these results emerge from a broad class of division control mechanisms (including the adder mechanism as a particular case) requiring a certain scaling form of the so-called "division hazard rate function", which defines the probability rate of dividing as a function of measurable parameters. This gives a rationale for the universal body-size distributions observed in microbial ecosystems across many microbial species, presumably dividing with multiple mechanisms. Additionally, our experiments show a crossover between fast and slow growth in the relation between individual-cell growth rate and division time, which can be understood in terms of different regimes of genome replication control.},

	abstract = {Erythrocyte invasion by Plasmodium falciparum merozoites is an essential step for parasite survival and hence the pathogenesis of malaria. Invasion has been studied intensively, but our cellular understanding has been limited by the fact that it occurs very rapidly: invasion is generally complete within 1 min, and shortly thereafter the merozoites, at least in in vitro culture, lose their invasive capacity. The rapid nature of the process, and hence the narrow time window in which measurements can be taken, have limited the tools available to quantitate invasion. Here we employ optical tweezers to study individual invasion events for what we believe is the first time, showing that newly released P. falciparum merozoites, delivered via optical tweezers to a target erythrocyte, retain their ability to invade. Even spent merozoites, which had lost the ability to invade, retain the ability to adhere to erythrocytes, and furthermore can still induce transient local membrane deformations in the erythrocyte membrane. We use this technology to measure the strength of the adhesive force between merozoites and erythrocytes, and to probe the cellular mode of action of known invasion inhibitory treatments. These data add to our understanding of the erythrocyte-merozoite interactions that occur during invasion, and demonstrate the power of optical tweezers technologies in unraveling the blood-stage biology of malaria. © 2014 Biophysical Society.},

One of the most intriguing and least understood stages in this cycle is the brief preinvasion period during which dynamic merozoite-red-cell interactions align the merozoite apex in preparation for penetration. Studies of the molecular mechanisms involved in this process face formidable technical challenges, requiring multiple observations of merozoite egress-invasion sequences in live cultures under controlled experimental conditions, using high-resolution microscopy and a variety of fluorescent imaging tools. Here we describe a first successful step in the development of a fully automated, robotic imaging platform to enable such studies. Schizont-enriched live cultures of P. falciparum were set up on an inverted stage microscope with software-controlled motorized functions. By applying a variety of imaging filters and selection criteria, we identified infected red cells that were likely to rupture imminently, and recorded their coordinates. We developed a video-image analysis to detect and automatically record merozoite egress events in 100{\%} of the 40 egress-invasion sequences recorded in this study. We observed a substantial polymorphism of the dynamic condition of pre-egress infected cells, probably reflecting asynchronies in the diversity of confluent processes leading to merozoite release. © 2013 Biophysical Society.},

As demonstrated hereby, mice expressing sickle Hb do not succumb to experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). This protective effect is exerted irrespectively of parasite load, revealing that sickle Hb confers host tolerance to Plasmodium infection. Sickle Hb induces the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in hematopoietic cells, via a mechanism involving the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Carbon monoxide (CO), a byproduct of heme catabolism by HO-1, prevents further accumulation of circulating free heme after Plasmodium infection, suppressing the pathogenesis of ECM. Moreover, sickle Hb inhibits activation and/or expansion of pathogenic CD8+T cells recognizing antigens expressed by Plasmodium, an immunoregulatory effect that does not involve Nrf2 and/or HO-1. Our findings provide insight into molecular mechanisms via which sickle Hb confers host tolerance to severe forms of malaria. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

A measurement of the mechanical properties at very small amplitudes is obtained by fluctuation analysis, and compared to the stiffness at larger deformations, obtained by stretching the cellsviaoptical traps whilst monitoring the force. The cells are also probed at various conditions of pre-strain. These measurements show clearly a stiffening with strain and with pre-strain, which is strongest at low frequencies of deformation. The cell is measured to be slightly softer from fluctuation analysis, but consistent simply with the fact that the oscillation amplitude in fluctuations is very small.

	abstract = {Membranes containing a wide variety of ternary mixtures of high chain-melting temperature lipids, low chain-melting temperature lipids, and cholesterol undergo lateral phase separation into coexisting liquid phases at a miscibility transition. When membranes are prepared from a ternary lipid mixture at a critical composition, they pass through a miscibility critical point at the transition temperature. Since the critical temperature is typically on the order of room temperature, membranes provide an unusual opportunity in which to perform a quantitative study of biophysical systems that exhibit critical phenomena in the two-dimensional Ising universality class. As a critical point is approached from either high or low temperature, the scale of fluctuations in lipid composition, set by the correlation length, diverges. In addition, as a critical point is approached from low temperature, the line tension between coexisting phases decreases to zero. Here we quantitatively evaluate the temperature dependence of line tension between liquid domains and of fluctuation correlation lengths in lipid membranes to extract a critical exponent, $\nu$. We obtain $\nu$ = 1.2 ± 0.2, consistent with the Ising model prediction $\nu$ = 1. We also evaluate the probability distributions of pixel intensities in fluorescence images of membranes. From the temperature dependence of these distributions above the critical temperature, we extract an independent critical exponent of $\beta$ = 0.124 ± 0.03, which is consistent with the Ising prediction of $\beta$ = 1/8. © 2008 by the Biophysical Society.},
